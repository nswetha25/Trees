<!-- You can have a combination of static HTML pages and dynamic content generated by servlets in a single web application. This is a common approach in web development where you use static HTML pages for the parts of your site that don't change frequently and servlets (or other server-side technologies) for generating dynamic content or handling more complex logic.

Here's a typical scenario:

Static HTML Pages:

Use HTML pages for static content like your home page, about page, contact page, etc.
These pages can be created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and don't involve server-side processing.
They are served directly by the web server or servlet container without any dynamic generation.
Dynamic Content with Servlets:

Use servlets (or other server-side technologies) for dynamic content or functionality that requires server-side processing.
Servlets can generate HTML dynamically based on data, handle user input, interact with databases, and perform other server-side tasks.
The dynamic content generated by servlets can be integrated into your static HTML pages.
Combining Both:

In your web application structure, you might have a mix of static HTML files and servlets organized in a way that makes sense for your project.
The static content can reside in the webapp directory, and servlets can be placed in the appropriate Java package or directory structure.
Web Application Deployment:

When you deploy your web application, both static HTML files and servlets are part of the deployment.
The servlet container (e.g., Tomcat) is responsible for serving the static files directly and invoking the servlets when dynamic content is requested. -->
